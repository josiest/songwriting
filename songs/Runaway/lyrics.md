### Chorus I
I think I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

I'm gonna make my way  
Across the whole United States  
I'm gonna pave the path of fame  
And everybody's gonna know my name

### Verse I
In the dead of night  
I will be lying awake  
Planning ways I can escape

It won't take much time  
To leave my home  
Now the future's unknown

I can climb out my window  
To the ground below  
And pack up my clothes  
Get on my bike  
And everybody will know

### Chorus II
That I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

And it could take all day  
Yeah it could take up all of the night  
To find, gotta find my way  
If it takes up all of the night

### Verse II
Well life just ain't as easy  
As it's made out to be  
They say if you can believe

Then it'll all come easy  
But it wasn't for me  
Even if I believed

And I'm gettin tired  
Of all this crap that I pull  
To please the system  
You know, it's not very cool  
Now I know   

### Chorus III
That I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

I'm gonna make my way  
Across the whole United States
I'm gonna pave the path of fame  
And everybody's gonna know my name  
I'm gonna put all those who doubt me to shame

### Chorus IV
That I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

And it could take all day  
Yeah, it could take up all of the night  
But I won't continue to stay  
In the same place all of my life  
That's right
