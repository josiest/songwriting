### Chorus I
I think I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

I'm gonna make my way  
Across the whole United States  
I'm gonna pave the path of fame  
And everybody's gonna know my name

### Verse I
In the dead of night  
I will be lying awake  
Planning ways I can escape

And it won't take much time  
To leave my home  
Now the future's unknown

I can climb out my window  
To the ground below  
And pack up my clothes  
Get on my bike  
And everybody will know

### Chorus II
That I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
And leave this fucking place behind  

And it could take all day  
Yeah it could take up all of the night  
To find, gotta find my way  
If it takes up all of the night

### Verse II
And I must have it easy  
Or so I'm made to believe  
That in my youth I am free

But I don't find it easy  
To be constantly  
In the shadow of weeds

Yeah, I'm gettin tired  
Of all this shit that I pull  
To appease the system  
~I'm gonna flunk out of school  
Oh I know   

### Chorus III
So I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
And leave all of my worries behind

I'm gonna run away  
And I won't look back this time  
I'm gonna pave my own way  
And I'll sing to the god up high  
That your lies are no longer mine
Uh huh

### Chorus IV
I'm gonna hit the road  
Never gonna do what I'm told  
I'm gonna fly through the night  
I'm gonna lie to my parents outright  
That's right

And it could take all day  
Yeah, it could take up all of the night  
But I won't continue to stay  
In this lie of a life ~anymore  
That's right
