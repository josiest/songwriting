### Chorus I

And so I'll pack my bags  
And I'll move back to Spanaway  
Where I will lay eventually
Underneath the ground

For I know in this god-forsaken  
City, nothing's gonna change  
In Spanaway, I'll count my days  
Until the sun goes down

### Chorus II

And yes, I have my flaws
But I'm working on them everyday  
Oh I can change, ~I know it
I just need a little help

But for now it's all I can  
To keep myself ~from losing it  
In Spanaway where I am slowly
~Rotting in the ground
