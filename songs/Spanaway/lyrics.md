### Verse I

Now I find myself upon the end  
Of the road I've been on  
Here I thought I'd settled down  
After drifting for so long  

But rent is due and I'm still looking
For another job  
For the one I couldn't keep  
Would have been the death of me  

### Pre-Chorus I

~I look around and all I see  
~Are strangers to me, Oh how I know  
~That there's nothing left here  
~For me anymore  

But I know that the answer's
Been Sitting in front of me  
All along

And I can't keep ignoring  
The eventuality  
Of going home

### Chorus I

And so I'll pack my bags  
And I'll move back to Spanaway  
Where I will lay eventually
Underneath the ground

For I know in this god-forsaken  
City, nothing's gonna change  
In Spanaway, I'll count my days  
Until the sun goes down

### Pre-Chorus II

Now that I'm sitting in  
The passenger seat of my mother's car  
As we drive to a city  
That's two hundred miles far

We discuss how I dress
Differently these days, for I know
Her religion tells her
To see me in shame
But she says

I may not understand,
But I'll love you any way
You present

### Chorus II

I know that I'm lucky just to  
Have someone to fall upon  
But I'm not okay with how everything  
Is falling apart

For I know this fucking god-forsaken  
City is a prison cell  
But oh well, in Spanaway
I'll find another start

### Chorus III

And yes, I have my flaws
But I'm working on them everyday  
Oh I can change, ~I know it
I just need a little help

But for now it's all I can  
To keep myself ~from losing it  
In Spanaway where I am slowly
~Rotting in the ground
