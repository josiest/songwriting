### Verse I

So I find myself upon the end of  
The road I've been on  
And what a foolish thought that I  
Could settle after long

But rent is due and I'm still looking  
For another job  
For the one I couldn't keep  
Would have been the death of me  

### Pre-Chorus I

~I look around and  
~All I see are strangers to me  
There's nothing left here  
For me anymore and I know

That the answer's been  
~Sitting in front of me all along  
And I can't keep ignoring the  
Eventuality of going home

### Chorus I

And so I'll pack my bags  
And I'll move back to Spanaway  
Where I will lay eventually  
Underneath the ground

For I know in this god-forsaken  
City, nothing's gonna change  
In Spanaway, I'll count my days  
Until the sun goes down

### Verse II

Now I'm sitting in the passenger seat  
Of my mother's car  
And silence is the soundtrack of  
The road we've seen so far

And we haven't really spoken in  
A year or maybe more  
But now we drive to Spanaway  
Two hundred miles far

### Pre-Chorus II

~I speak my mind, for I  
~Know it will come up eventually  
We discuss how I dress  
Differently These days, for I know

Her religion tells her  
To see me in shame, but she says  
I may not understand, but I'll  
Love you any way you present

### Chorus II

I know that I'm lucky just to  
Have someone to fall upon  
But I'm not okay with how everything  
Is falling apart

For I know this fucking god-forsaken  
City is a prison cell  
But oh well, in Spanaway  
I'll find another start

### Chorus III

And yes, I have my flaws  
But I'm working on them everyday  
Oh I can change, ~I know it  
I just need a little help

But for now it's all I can  
To keep myself ~from losing it  
In Spanaway where I am slowly  
~Rotting in the ground
