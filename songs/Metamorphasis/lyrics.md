### Verse A.I
Buried in between the grains of dirt  
I grow under the shadow of a man  
Whose image takes it's shape from the weeds around  
And his image is the reflection of who I am

But who I am is barely anything  
A shadow casted from the weeds  
As the sun shifts, the shadows drif  
The shadows over me

### Verse A.II
Under the image of a man  
I knew only what his voice wanted me to  
But as the shadows leaning over me  
Start transforming, I no longer know what's true

Buried somewhere in the grains of dirt  
My eyes once tightened shut, now open free  
~Slowly, I start to feel my body  
~Return to me

### Verse B.I
And I wouldn't dream of  
Giving up myself  
To the thought that my world was  
The lies of someone else  
Someone else, someone else

### Verse B.II
Now I wander  
Alone without direction  
With a dream of ever finding  
My own reflection  
Do I still grow in the shadow of a man?

### Verse C.I
I am only a seed  
Planted deep within the dirt  
I look up to the sun  
But the surface is too far

Behind all the weeds  
And the shade, I have learned  
I look up and there's no  
Telling what I'll become

### Chorus I
Because I don't know if I'll ever grow  
Every day is just the same  
Just a part of the shadows' game

The shadows that rule my light  
The shadows that make it night

### Verse C.II
Deep down in my roots  
I can feel something stirring  
~Hope for a body that's lost  
~To return itself to me

Inside of me, ooh  
I can feel a fire burning  
So tell me what is the cost  
That one day I might break free

### Chorus II
Because I don't know if I'll ever grow  
Every day is just the same  
Just a part of the shadows' game, ooh

And I don't know what I'll become  
A queen or a pawn  
Or a weed in the infinite lawn

The weeds that grow upon this ground  
The weeds that run me down

### Outro
I am only a seed  
I look up to the sun  
I am only a seed  
I look up to the sun  
Behind all the weeds  
I look up and there's none

I am only a child  
And my eyes have only just opened  
To a whole 'nother reality  
I don't know  
Fo I am only a child
