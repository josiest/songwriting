### Pre-Verse

Leave, Leave

Leave, Leave

### Verse I

Falling autumn seed you've gone 'way

You are blowing in the breeze in the morn of the day

Where you will land, nobody can say

But they'll send you on your way back home

### Pre-Verse

### Verse II

Little autumn seed you are free

To experience the breath of the wandering breeze

You don't know where you are or what you will be

As you venture into the unknown

### Verse III

In the autumn you will have seen

The eye of the storm and the calm of the stream

But when the sun goes away, the waves will then sing

That you should be on your way back home

### Bridge I

'Cuz then the eye of the storm will freeze

And the calm of the stream will freeze

And the waves of the deep, deep sea

They will crash against the shore

Even stronger than before

And the snow falls down

To the aging ground you seek

### Bridge II

Listen to them calling out

Calls the breeze of the wind

Listen to them calling out,

They want you on your way back home 

### Pre-Verse

### Verse I (Final Verse)

Falling autumn seed you've gone 'way

You are blowing in the breeze in the morn of the day

Where you will land, nobody can say

But they'll send you on your way back home

Yeah they will send you on your way back home

Oh they will send you on your way back home
