### Verse I
Ooh, where am I now  
Oh, look what I've become  
It's been oh, so long  
Since I stepped into the dark  
Now I've stumbled all the way into  
The depths of my old heart  
And all around are scars  
But it's okay now, it's fine  
It's been a long, long time

### Verse II
Ooh, what do I see  
When I look into the mirror, is it really me?  
I see in my mind  
And what it has come to be  
And where shadows used to linger  
A flower now takes seed  
And I hope one day  
That a bloom, it will be  
In not such a long, long time

### Interlude

### Verse III
Ooh, and here I am  
Asking what next will I be  
I've been a fool and a fraud  
And everything in between  
But now that I am older  
I've finally come to see  
My mistakes and flaws  
For the value left behind  
It's been a long, long time

### Verse IV
Ooh, there is a stream  
And a stone beneath the water  
Was jagged and obscene  
But with the current's flow  
Comes the softening of its seams  
And over time it's faces  
Will gradually convene  
And I know one day  
After polish, it will shine  
After a long, long time
