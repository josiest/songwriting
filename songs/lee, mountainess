~Twelve jagged edges
Wouldn't match my pain
From your ignorance
I now hold in vain

Tired of waiting
To show you

Bridge I

Bring back my lover, today
Ah, I would

Bring back my lover, today
~A lie, a frame, a dead man slain
~By I only know who

Would you try to understand
~A ruined house upon the sand
I can only go so far
Without you
My love I cannot fall
Any further

My sweet, mountainess
I have not forgotten you
~Live on and be grateful
I owe it to you
