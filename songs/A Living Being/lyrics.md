### Verse I
And I know one thing about the ocean  
The tides, they quickly turn away  
And they go on in perpetual motion

All around I see nothing but fallout  
From the war we continue to wage  
Against the Earth and all the wisdom she's found

### Chorus I
And man, great culture of Earth  
Do you think you own it all?  
All of life is but one living being

### Verse II
~Is it a sin to loathe my country?  
~Should I try harder to root for my own land?  
When all it's known is blindness and oppression

### Chorus II
And Lord, oh heaven above  
Was it you that made my home?  
All of life is but one living being

### Interlude

### Chorus III
All the stars in their ocean above  
Will keep on spinning when we're gone  
All of life is but one living being

### Final Verse (Verse I)
And I know one thing about the ocean  
The tides, they quickly turn away
