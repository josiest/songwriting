### Chorous I

What's a line of code  
To a line of cambros  
Behind the kitchen bar
Of a minimum wage job

Oh I would make the trade  
Any day, but who am I to claim  
Such a privelege for my own

### Chorus II

What's a line of code  
To a line of coke  
In the living room  
Of someone I barely know

Oh I would make the trade  
Any day, but who am I to claim  
Such a privelege for my own

### Chorus III

What's a stable home  
To the living room sofa  
Of a friend of a friend  
And I've overstayed my welcome  
Once again

Oh I would make the trade  
Any day, but who am I to claim  
Such a privelege for my own
