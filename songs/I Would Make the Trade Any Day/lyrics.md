### Verse

What's a line of code  
To a line of coke  
In the living room  
Of someone I barely know

### Chorus

Oh I would make the trade  
Any day, but who am I to claim  
Such a privelege for my own

### Verse

What's a stable home  
~To the couch of someone 
~I barely know

### Chorus

Oh I would make the trade  
Any day, but who am I to claim  
Such a privelege for my own
