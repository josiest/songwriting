# Verse I

When I saw you the other day  
~You were stunning in my eyes  
~And things were seemingly okay  
In fact were more than fine  
Only a matter of time  
Before things stop going my way  
...  
...  
...  
...

# Chorus

Don't tell me, tell me that you  
Want something more and then you  
change your mind. I can't take it  
Been feeling restless lately and I  
I wanna see you all the time  
Want to feel your lips against mine  
But you don't want me and that's fine
