### Verse I
Winter, my love  
Winter, my love  
Surprised to see  
You lingering  
~In the light of the door  
Where Spring would greet us before

~And today I see  
Sacred geometries  
Descending from  
The heavens above  
A journey made ever more  
Frequently than before

Your frozen breath  
Will fill our lungs in the end

### Verse II
Summer, what a dream  
Summer, what a dream  
A hazy sky  
~From distant fires  
Do tell me, my old friend  
~What brought upon your burning wrath

The daylight sky becomes  
Painted red from  
The evergreen  
Dancing trees  
Like winter you generously  
Send your gift like snow from above

Your burning breath  
Will fill our lungs in the end

#### Verse III
You bring the cold and  
The freezing snow and  
~With bated breath  
~We wait for your end  
~So tell me what's happening
~To the beauty that you hold in store

And I realize how  
You're old and wise now  
But you still seem  
But you still seem  
~To have the bite of
~The dragon's bone crushing jaws

Your frozen breath  
Has filled my lungs again
