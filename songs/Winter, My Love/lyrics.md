### Verse I
Winter, my love  
Winter, my love  
I know you've seen  
I know you've seen  
The heart of my dear earth  
Fiery as life ever was

And I realize how  
You're old and wise now  
But you still seem  
But you still seem  
~To have the bite of
~The jaws of a dragon

Your frozen breath  
Has filled my lungs again

### Verse II
You bring the cold and  
The freezing snow and  
~With bated breath  
~We wait for your end  
~So tell me what's happening
~To the beauty that you hold in store

~And today I see  
Sacred geometries  
Descending from  
The heavens above  
Are falling ever more  
~Frequently than before

Your frozen breath  
Will fill our lungs in the end

#### Verse III
Summer, what a dream  
Summer, what a dream  
A hazy sky  
~From distant fires  
Will you tell me again  
~What brought upon your burning wrath

The daylight skies become
Painted red from
The evergreen
Dancing trees
Like winter you generously
Bring snow from the heavens above

Your burning breath
Will fill our lungs in the end
