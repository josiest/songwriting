### Verse I
Winter, my love  
Winter, my love  
I know you've seen  
I know you've seen  
The heart of my dear earth  
Fiery as life ever was

And I realize how  
You're old and wise now  
But you still seem  
But you still seem  
To have the life of  
Our familiar molten core

Your frozen breath  
Has filled my lungs again
