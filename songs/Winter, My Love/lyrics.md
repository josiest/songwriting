### Verse I
Winter, my love  
Winter, my love  
I know you've seen  
I know you've seen  
The heart of my dear earth  
Fiery as life ever was

And I realize how  
You're old and wise now  
But you still seem  
But you still seem  
To have the life of  
~Our familiar molten core

Your frozen breath  
Has filled my lungs again

### Verse II
You bring the cold and  
The freezing snow and  
~With bated breath  
~We wait for your end  
~But I can now only see  
The beauty that you have in store

~The warming hearth we seek  
~After sacred geometries  
Have fallen from  
The heavens above  
~But with each passing year  
~You suffer from our selfishness

Your frozen breath  
~will fill our lungs in the end
