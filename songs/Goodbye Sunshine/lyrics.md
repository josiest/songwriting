### Verse I
Goodbye sunshine  
It's been nice to have you around  
~When the days were rough  
~But you've had enough

~Of my intentions  
And it's a wonder you stuck around  
For the longest time  
~But it's about time

For you've set  
On the horizon  
Set a fire between the sea

That separates the skyline  
You fall silently beneath  
Goodbye sunshine
Goodbye sunshine

### Verse II
Hello darkness  
You've been lingering for a while  
Now you're here to stay  
But it seems okay

If I hold your  
Outstreached arm close to my heart  
It almost feels the same  
~As the sun that came

But she's gone  
She's out of sight
~She left me trembling in the dark

And I'm struggling to find  
Any light that she left behind  
Goodbye sunshine  
Goodbye sunshine
