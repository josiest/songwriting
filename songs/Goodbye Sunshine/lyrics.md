# Goodbye Sunshine

### Verse I
Goodbye sunshine  
It's been nice to have you around  
~But the days were rough  
~And you've had enough

~Of my intentions  
It's a wonder you stuck around  
For the longest time  
~But it's about time

For you've set  
On the horizon  
Set a fire upon the sea

That separates the skyline  
You fall silently beneath  
Goodbye sunshine

### Verse II
Hello darkness  
You've been lingering for a while  
Now you're here to stay  
But it seems okay

If I hold your  
Outstretched arm close to my heart  
It almost feels the same  
~As the sun that came

But she's gone  
She's out of sight  
~She left me trembling in the dark

And I'm struggling to find  
Any light that she left behind  
Goodbye sunshine
 
### Bridge
If only I could undo  
The trouble I have caused  
The patterns we've fallen into  
Have only caused me harm  
~And you disdain  
The mess that I have left for you again  
Is yet another verse  
~In a song that isn't worth  
~The trouble left behind  
~And so you say goodbye

### Verse III
So goodbye Sunshine  
~You've been brighter than any day  
~But I must say goodbye  
For you cannot stay

And it seems like  
I may never see you again  
But it will be okay  
Because another day

Will arise  
On the horizon  
Casting light upon the sea

~But for now there's only darkness  
~And beyond, I cannot see  
Goodbye sunshine
