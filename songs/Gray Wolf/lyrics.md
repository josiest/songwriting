### Verse I
Gray, gray, gray wolf  
Why won't you  
Why won't you  
Howl, howl, howl  
At the moon  
At the moon  
Your pack has left you too

Dark, dark, dark woods  
You travel through  
You travel through  
Where is your song  
~You left it so long  
It's been forgotten  
~And now you're on your own
