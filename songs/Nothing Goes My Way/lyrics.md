### Verse I
Every time I think of how  
Far I've drifted away  
Is just another nail upon  
The coffin where I lay  
The voices in my head  
Always tell me the same thing  
There's nothing you can do  
To make a change

Every day is just another  
Chance at giving in  
Or is it that every day is  
A chance to begin  
To overcome the bog that I have  
Been sinking in  
But who could find the strength  
To pull away  

### Chorus I
No, nothing ever goes my way  
Who could listen to a voice  
That's always saying

To look forward to a brighter day  
When everyday it seems  
To just be raining

The storm clouds just won't go away  
They linger in the sky each day  
And alyway seem to say  
Nothing will ever go your way

### Verse II
Once upon a time  
I was so confident and green  
The world was at my fingertips  
Or that was how it seemed  
But then I stumbled over  
And shattered all my dreams  
And watched as the wind  
Blew them all away

### Chorus II
No, nothing ever goes my way  
Despite that I have tried  
So hard to fight it  

It seems fate will always have its way  
And Failure is the fate  
That I've invited

And now I'm stuck inside this day  
Where everything is cold and gray  
And nothing seems to change  
Nothing will ever go my way
