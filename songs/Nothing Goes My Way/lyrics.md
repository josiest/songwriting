### Verse I

### Chorus
Nothing ever goes my way  
Who could listen to a voice  
That's always saying

To look forward to a brighter day  
When everyday it seems  
To just be raining

The storm clouds just won't go away  
They linger in the sky each day  
And alyway seem to say  
Nothing will ever go your way
