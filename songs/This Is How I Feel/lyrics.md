### Verse I

So, this must be how you feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
And you don't care what I do  
As long as I don't talk to you

And I know that isn't what you said  
Though it really felt that way  
Running through my head  
And I feel like a child  
Just saying it outloud

But I'll say it anyway  
'Cause this is how I feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
'Cause I can't get over you

### Verse II

But now, you're giving me a chance  
Though this olive branch  
Is wilted, old, and cracked  
~And I don't know if I want it back

So, do I say goodbye  
'Cause I don't know why  
~I even thought I'd try  
I guess I thought I'd grown  
But I guess I should have known

That I can't deny  
This is how I feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
'Cause I can't get over you

### Chorus I

But now I think I might be over  
How I felt about you  
Because I'm such a fucking mess  
Whenever I'm around you

And I'm so over feeling like  
A fucking loser it's true  
But all these memories I have of you  
Haunt me every year or two

And I just wanna be free from  
The pain I feel when they do  
'Cause every fucking time I feel  
Like I still wanna be around you

But I know how you must feel  
Because I think I'm feeling it too  
That all this weight I'm carrying  
Sucks to just dump on you

So I'm sorry I dragged you along  
It was selfish of me it's true  
I just got confused 'cause I  
Wanted to be around you

### Verse III

So, is this how it ends  
Though I really thought that we  
Could still be friends  
But I put you through it all over again

And I can't pretend  
Like nothing happened  
~And ignore the consequence  
I got caught up in my lie  
That somehow, you and I

Could be close again  
But this is how you feel  
~Like I'm a fucking loser  
~'Cause I can't get over you

### Verse IV

But now, you're giving me a chance  
And this olive branch  
Is wilted, old, and cracked  
~And I don't know if I want it back

~What else can I do  
'Cause I'm the one who  
Keeps bothering you  
Do I say it's about time  
And leave it all behind

But I don't want to  
'Cause this is how I feel  
~Like I wanna make things right  
~Again with you

### Chorus II

'Cause long ago you told me that you  
Thought that we'd grow into  
Old friends, and maybe I still wanna  
See that vision come true

But I'm so over feeling like  
A fucking loser for you  
I just want some peace of mind but I'm  
A fucking mess around you

And I don't wanna deal with this shit  
Any more, yeah I'm through  
But all of these memories I have of you  
Haunt me every year or two

And I just wanna be free of  
The pain I feel when they do  
'Cause everything is so confusing  
When I wanna be around you

But I know how you must feel  
Because I think I'm feeling it too  
That all this weight I'm carrying  
I shouldn't have put on you

So I'm sorry I dragged you along  
It was selfish of me, it's true  
I just got confused 'cause I  
Wanted to be around you
