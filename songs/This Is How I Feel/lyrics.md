### Verse I

So, this is how you feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
And you don't care what I do  
As long as I don't talk to you

So, I guess this is goodbye  
And I don't know why I  
~Even fucking tried  
I guess I thought I'd grown  
But I guess I should have known

That I can't deny  
This is how I feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
'Cause I can't get over you

### Verse II

So, this how it ends  
Though I really thought that we  
Could still be friends  
But I put you through it all over again

And I can't pretend  
Like nothing happened  
~And ignore the consequence  
I got caught up in my lie  
That somehow, you and I

Could be close again  
But this is how you feel  
~Like I'm a fucking loser  
~'Cause I can't get over you

### Chorus

But now I feel I'm maybe over
Everything about you  
Because I'm such a fucking mess  
Whenever I'm around you

And I don't wanna deal with this shit  
Any more than you do  
I just wanna be free from
The pain I feel when I think about you

And I'm sorry I dragged you in this  
I shouldn't have involved you  
I just got confused 'cause I still  
Wanna be around you

### Verse III

Now, you're giving me a chance  
~But it feels like you just  
~Want me off your back  
But maybe I'm  
Okay with that

Cause I'm over you  
I'm over all the shit  
I put us through
