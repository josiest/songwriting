### Verse I

So, this is how you feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
And you don't care what I do  
As long as I don't talk to you

So, I guess this is goodbye  
And I don't know why I  
Even fucking tried  
I guess I thought I'd grown  
But I guess I should have known

That I can't deny  
This is how I feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
'Cause I can't get over you

### Verse II

So, this how it ends  
Though I really thought that we  
Could still be friends  
But I put you through it all over again

And I can't pretend  
Like nothing happened  
~And ignore the consequence  
I got caught up in my lie  
That somehow, you and I

Could be close again  
But this is how you feel  
~Like I'm a fucking loser  
~'Cause I can't get over you
