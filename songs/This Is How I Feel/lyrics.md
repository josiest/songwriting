### Verse I

So, this is how you feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
And you don't care what I do  
As long as I don't talk to you

So, I guess this is goodbye  
And I don't know why I  
~Even fucking tried  
I guess I thought I'd grown  
But I guess I should have known

That I can't deny  
This is how I feel  
Like I'm a fucking loser  
'Cause I can't get over you

### Verse II

So, this how it ends  
Though I really thought that we  
Could still be friends  
But I put you through it all over again

And I can't pretend  
Like nothing happened  
~And ignore the consequence  
I got caught up in my lie  
That somehow, you and I

Could be close again  
But this is how you feel  
~Like I'm a fucking loser  
~'Cause I can't get over you

### Chorus I

But now I feel I'm maybe over  
How I felt about you  
Because I'm such a fucking mess  
Whenever I'm around you

And I don't wanna deal with this shit  
Any more than you do  
I just wanna be free from  
The pain I feel when I think about you

And I'm sorry I dragged you in this  
I shouldn't have involved you  
I just got confused 'cause I still  
Wanna be around you

### Verse III

But now, you're giving me a chance  
Though this olive branch  
Is wilted, old, and cracked  
~And I don't know if I'm okay with it

~What else can I do  
'Cause I'm the one who  
Keeps bothering you  
Do I say it's about time  
And leave it all behind

But it would be untrue  
'Cause this is how I feel  
~Like I wanna make things right  
~Again with you

### Chorus II

'Cause long ago you told me that you  
Thought that we'd grow into  
Old friends, and maybe I still wanna  
See that vision come true

And I'm so over feeling like  
A fucking loser, it's true  
I want some peace of mind but I'm  
A fucking mess around you

And I don't wanna deal with this shit  
Any more, I'm tellin' you  
But all of these memories I have of you  
Haunt me every year or two

I just wanna be free from  
The pain I feel when they do  
But then I get so confused  
'Cause I still wanna be around you

I'm sorry I dragged you in this  
It was selfish of me to do  
I just got confused 'cause I still  
Wanna be around you
