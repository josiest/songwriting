### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Finds us in the night calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort  
As you were lying next to me  
I had one thing on my mind

### Chorus I
~This moment will linger on  
The morning would only come too soon

### Bridge I
~In the weeks that followed  
~I didn't know what to feel  
~What connection did we have before  
~But the more of you I had  
~The more I wanted so bad

### Verse II
Oh in the winter  
~When we were at the skating rink  
I made myself into a fool

When you told me we  
That we were never meant to be  
~I cried the whole night through

### Chorus II
I didn't know what to do  
Because I'd fallen in love with you

### Bridge II
~And in the months that followed  
~We still held our love platonic  
~You showed to me the light inside  
~That cast all my shadows aside

### Verse III
~But all of the time  
~My feelings only grew for you  
~Despite my best attempts

~To keep them inside  
~The strongest pain that I'd endure  
~To suppress my love for you

### Chorus III
~I'd move on if I only could  
But I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
