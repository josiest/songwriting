### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Found us in the night, calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort from  
Your body lying next to mine  
The touch of your breath on my mind

### Chorus I
This moment will linger on  
But morning would only come too soon

### Verse II
Oh when the winter  
Found us walking at each other's side  
I made myself into a fool

With all of my ignorance  
Before you, it was clear to see 
That I just wasn't meant for you

### Chorus II
Though my heart was torn in two   
I'd fallen in love with you

### Bridge
But every time that I saw you again  
You showed me a new kind of light, and I  
...  
...  
...  
... 

### Verse III
Oh at each other's side  
Time and time again  
~The love that we shared, so pure

~And over time  
~You'd become so close a friend  
But I still wanted so much more

### Chorus II
Lord knows how I've tried  
To cast my feelings aside

### Verse IV
But all of the time  
My feelings only grew for you  
Despite my best attempts

To keep them inside  
The strongest pain that I'd endure  
If only I could bring them to an end

### Chorus IV
But what more can I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
