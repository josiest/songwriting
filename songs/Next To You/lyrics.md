### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Finds us in the night calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort  
As you were lying next to me  
I had one thing on my mind

### Chorus I
~This moment will linger on  
The morning would only come too soon

### Bridge I
~At first I didn't know what to feel  
But every time that I saw you again  
You showed me a new kind of light  
~And I knew from then

### Verse II
Oh in the winter  
~When we were at the skating rink  
I made myself into a fool

When you told me we  
That we were never meant to be  
~I cried the whole night through

### Chorus II
I didn't know what to do  
Because I'd fallen in love with you

### Bridge II
~But we'd carry on  
~Sharing with each other a love platonic  
~You showed to me the light inside  
~That cast all my shadows aside

### Verse III
But all of the time  
My feelings only grew for you  
Despite my best attempts

To keep them inside  
The strongest pain that I'd endure  
If only I could bring them to an end

### Chorus III
But what more can I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
