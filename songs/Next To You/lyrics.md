### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Finds us in the night calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort  
As you were lying next to me  
I had one thing on my mind

### Chorus I
~This moment will linger on  
The morning would only come too soon

### Verse II
--

Oh when you told me we
were never meant to be that way
I cried the whole night through

### Chorus II
I didn't know what to do
Because I'd fallen in love with you

### Verse III
Oh in the winter
~When we were at the skating rink
I made a fool of myself

~But since that day
~You still showed to me the light inside
~That cast all my shadows away

### Chorus III
~In spite of me trying not to
I love you, I love you, I do
I love you, I love you, I do
I love you, I love you, I do
