### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Finds us in the night calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort  
As you were lying next to me  
I had one thing on my mind

### Chorus I
~This moment will linger on  
The morning would only come too soon

### Verse II
~I didn't know how to process my
~feelings for you
~Were you a friend or a love

Oh when you told me we  
~Were never meant to be that way  
~I cried the whole night through

### Chorus II
I didn't know what to do  
Because I'd fallen in love with you

### Verse III
Oh in the winter  
~When we were at the skating rink  
I made a fool of myself

~But since that day  
~You still showed to me the light inside  
~That cast all my shadows away

### Chorus III
~In spite of me trying not to  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
