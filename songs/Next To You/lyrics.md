### Verse I
When the summer found us  
In the night, calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort from  
Your body lying next to mine  
The touch of your breath on my mind

### Chorus I
And this moment would linger on  
But morning would only come too soon

### Verse II
When the winter found us  
walking at each other's side  
I made myself into a fool

With all of my ignorance  
Before you, it was clear to see  
That I just wasn't meant for you

### Chorus II
So my heart was torn in two  
How can I resign my love for you

### Bridge
But every time ~that I saw you again  
Every night you and I would spend  
To hold you in my arms again;  
The fulcrum desire of you, how I long  
To spend all my nights next to you  
~A fantasy never to come true

### Verse III
At each other's side  
Time and time again  
Our love, so innocent and pure

Yet every night we'd spend  
Together had my heart condemned  
For I desired so much more

### Chorus II
Lord knows how I've tried  
To cast my feelings aside

### Verse IV
But all of the time  
My feelings only grew for you  
Despite my best attempts

To keep them inside  
The strongest pain that I'd endure  
If only I could bring them to an end

### Chorus IV
But what more can I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
