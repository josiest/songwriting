### Verse I
Oh when the summer  
Found us in the night calm and quiet  
I found myself at your side

Warmth and comfort  
As you were lying next to me  
~I had one thing on my mind

### Chorus I
~This moment will linger on  
And morning would only come too soon

### Verse II
Oh when the winter
Found us walking at each other's sides
I made myself into a fool

When you told me  
That we just weren't meant to be  
~I cried the whole night through

### Chorus II
I didn't know what to do  
Because I'd fallen in love with you

### Bridge
Yet since that day
...
And I didn't know how to feel  
But every time that I saw you again  
You showed me a new kind of light  
~And I knew from then

### Verse III
Oh at each other's side  
Time and time again  
The love that we shared, so pure

And over time  
You'd become so close a friend  
But I still wanted so much more

### Chorus II
Lord knows how I've tried
~To cast my feelings aside

### Verse IV
But all of the time  
My feelings only grew for you  
Despite my best attempts

To keep them inside  
The strongest pain that I'd endure  
If only I could bring them to an end

### Chorus IV
But what more can I do  
I love you, I love you, I do  
I love you, I love you, I do
