Title: ~A Living Being
Key: ~E Major

Verse I
-------

And I know one thing about the ocean
The tides, they quickly turn away
And they go on in perpetual motion

~Currently I am oppressed by fallout
~From the war we continue to fight
~Against the Earth and all the wisdom she's found

Chorus
------

And Lord, oh heaven above
Did you really make my home?
~A living being oversees all creation

Verse II
--------

~It's a sin to commit treason
~I try hard to root for my own land
But my blood has natural criticism

Chorus
------

And man, great culture of earth
Do you think you have it all?
~A living being oversees all creation
