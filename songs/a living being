Verse I
-------

      And I   know    one thing about the   ocean
            | I                           | IV
        The   tides, they quickly turn a-   way
            | vi          V               | IV
And they go   on             in perpetual   motion
            | ii                I     IV  |

            | ii                          | I

              All around I see nothing but  fallout
            | I                           | IV
   From the   war          we continue to   fight
            | vi              V           | IV
Against the   Earth    and all the wisdom   she's found
            | ii           I       IV     |

            | ii                          | I

Chorus
------

        And   Lord,                    oh   heaven above
            | ii                          | IV      V
                  Was it you that made my   home?
            | iii                         | IV
                  All of life      is but   one living being
            | IV                          | V          I

Verse II
--------

~                  Is it a sin to loathe my   country?
              | I                           | IV
~Should I try   harder   to root for my own   land?
              | vi        V                 | IV
~       Oh my   blood is boiling with criti-  cism
              | ii           I        IV    |

              | ii                          | I

Chorus
------

        And   man,                  great   culture of Earth
            | ii                          | IV         V
                  Do you think you own it   all?
            | iii                         | IV
                  All of life      is but   one living being
            | IV                          | V          I
