Title: ~A Living Being
Key: ~E Major

Verse I
-------

And I know one thing about the ocean
The tides, they quickly turn away
And they go on in perpetual motion

All around I see nothing but fallout
From the war we continue to fight
Against the Earth and all the wisdom she's found

Chorus
------

And Lord, oh heaven above
Was it you that made my home?
All of life is but one living being

Verse II
--------

~Is it a sin to loathe my country?
~Should try harder to root for my own land?
~Oh my blood is boiling with criticism

Chorus
------

And man, great culture of earth
Do you think you own it all?
All of life is but one living being
