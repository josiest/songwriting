### Verse I
~Seemingly infinite  
~Well I draw from  
~To lie through my teeth  
~When talking to you

### Verse II
~And now that I've missed  
~Any chance that I'd got  
Every moment I'm with you  
~Is salt in the wound

### Chorus
Ellie,  
~Bring me down

### Verse III
~Now there's nothing I can think of  
~That would match my pain  
~From my own lack of courage  
I now hold in vain

### Chorus
Tired of waiting  
For me

### Bridge I
Bring back my love, today  
Ah, I would

Bring back my love, today  
~A lie into pain, the heart that was slain  
~By I only know who

### Bridge II
Who would try to understand  
A ruined house upon the sand  
~I can only go so far  
Without you  
My love I cannot fall  
Any further

### Verse IV
My sweet love of mine  
I have not forgotten you  
Move on and be happy  
I owe it to you
