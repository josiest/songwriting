### Verse I
~seemingly infinite  
~well I draw from  
~to lie through my teeth  
~when talking to you

### Verse II
~And now that I've missed
~Any chance that I'd got
Every moment I'm with you
~Is salt in the wound

### Chorus
Ellie,
~Bring me down

### Verse III
~Twelve jagged edges  
Wouldn't match my pain  
~From my own lack of courage
I now hold in vain

### Chorus
Tired of waiting  
For me

### Bridge I
Bring back my love, today  
Ah, I would

Bring back my love, today  
~A lie into pain, the heart that was slain  
~By I only know who

### Bridge II
Who would try to understand  
A ruined house upon the sand  
~I can only go so far  
Without you  
My love I cannot fall  
Any further

### Verse IV
~My sweet mountainess  
I have not forgotten you  
~Move on and be grateful  
I owe it to you
