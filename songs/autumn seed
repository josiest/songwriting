              Falling         autumn          seed you've gone 'way
            | I               ii            | iii               ii
    You are   blowing in the breeze in the    morn of the day
            | IV                            | V
              Where    you will land,    no-  body can say
            | vi                            |          IV
But they'll   send you on your way   back     home

Verse II
--------

              Little          autumn          seed you are  free
            | I               ii            | iii           ii
      To ex-  perience the breath    of the   wandering breeze
            | IV                            | V
  You don't   Know    where you are      or   what you will be
            | vi                            |               IV
     As you   venture into   the      un-     known
            | V                             | I

Verse III
---------

              In the          autumn          you will have seen
            | I               ii            | iii           ii
        The   eye of the storm      and the   calm of the stream
            | IV                            | V
But when the  sun    goes away,         the   waves will then sing
            | vi                            |                 IV
   That you   should be on your way  back     home
            | V                             | I

Bridge I

  'Cuz then the   eye          of       the   storm
                | vi                        |
           will   freeze
                | I            ii           | iii       ii
        And the   calm         of       the   stream
                | vi                        |
           will   freeze
                | I            ii           | iii       ii
        And the   waves        of       the   deep, deep sea
                | IV                        |
      They will   crash   against       the   shore
                | II                        |
           Even  stronger      than     be-   fore
                | II                        |
        And the   snow falls down    to the   aging ground
                | V                         | IV
            you   seek
                | I            ii           | iii       ii

         Listen   to them calling out
                | IV                        |
      Calls the   breeze     of      the       wind
                | V                         | I
         Listen   to them calling out,  They   want you on your way
                | IV                        | V
