## Verse I
Love, why do you have to hold  
~Onto my heart so tightly  
~I can't even move along

And I can't handle another round  
...  
...

## Chorus I
And love, love is such a drag  
So tell me when it's over

## Chorus II
But then, then I see your face  
And all of my memories come rushing back  
With overwhelming force that I'm displaced  
...

And love, love is such a drag  
That I can't get over
