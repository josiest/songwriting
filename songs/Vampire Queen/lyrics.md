### Verse I
Everybody knows about the girl  
Who can win a boy's heart with the wink of an eye  
And everybody knows what she can do  
She can break a boy's heart in the blink of an eye

They say this girl does whatever she pleases  
With any silly boy who contracts her disease  
And before they can know what this girl is about  
She chews them up good and then she spits 'em right out

### Pre-Chorus
They say the red on her lips is the blood of her victims  
And the venom in her kiss has the power of a gun  
All the boys she attracts end up lying on their backs  
In their rooms all alone when she says they're not the one

### Chorus
She's a real mean vampire queen  
And it's not easy to find your footing  
When you're the victim of a heart breaking  
When you're the victim of a heart breaking

### Verse II
Well sit right down and I'll tell you a tale  
Of a fallen angel fresh out of hell

# Pre-Chorus
They say the red on her lips is the blood of her victims  
And the swing of her hips can knock a body down
