# Verse I

I want body
I want a body
I want somebody
To be

I want comfort
The warmth of another
I guess, a lover
To be

# Prechorus I

Someone who gives
Someone who does
Someone who loves
~A human being
Is it all that I ask for?

# Verse II

I want action
I want a reaction
That will bring satisfaction
To me

~But I want passion
I want more than empty
~Experiences. We
~could be ...

# Prechorus II

And then you were there
Lying with me
Knee between knee
~You and me
~Is this what I asked for?

# Chorus I
