# Songs I've written

This is a repository of songs I've written that I've put onto the cloud with
version control. The choice to use github instead of something like google drive
is purely because I like this workflow a lot better.

## Text File Notation

Some of the symbols in the text files can be somewhat cryptic, so this is a key
to serve as a reference

- '~' to be changed
- '--' to be filled in
