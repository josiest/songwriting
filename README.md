# Songs I've written

This is a repository of songs I've written that I've put onto the cloud with
version control. The choice to use github instead of something like google drive
is purely because I like this workflow a lot better.

## Repository Organization

- **`albums`**: Each file in the `albums` directory is a text file that names a
  planned album and holds a collection of song names I plan on having on that
  album.

- **`songs`**: A flat (as opposed to nested) collection of song lyrics along
  with their chord structures.

## Text File Notation

Some of the symbols in the text files can be somewhat cryptic, so this is a key
to serve as a reference

- '~' subject to change
- '--' to be filled in
